## Question 1

[***Part A***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/office/excel/available-resources-errors)
- First I would ask the client how long this problem has been going on for, and if they have been experiencing this issue in the past with Excel or any other applications.
- Second I would ask if they have ever closed Chrome or ever cleared the browsing cache.
- Third I would ask them if they have done any updates to Windows, Excel and Chrome.

***Part C***

*Here are some Websites on how to troubleshoot general Mircorsoft Applications*
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/office/office-client-welcome
- https://www.asus.com/ca-en/support/faq/1044609/
- https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/faqs/microsoft/microsoft-365-troubleshooting/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F&srsltid=AfmBOopN5pwbTqDlNAfEPfv9ZYlrYVcv4EClZ5oGysuWxa6HvjDeeLLq

1. the first website is by Mircosoft themselves. It is great in terms of everything being catagorized by applaction, so it makes it easier for you to navigate and find the solution you need for whatever applcation is giving you issues.
2. the scond site is by Asus, which seems more simplified by using images and a step by step method to help ypu solve your issue.
3. the third is by Lenovo, again this site is similar to Asus' approach with a step by step guide, but seems to go into a little more depth by using for FAQ's to help you find your solution. 

## Question 2

[**Tutorial 1**](https://uis.georgetown.edu/file-explorer/)<br/>
[**Tutorial 2**](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windowsbasics/working-with-files/1/)<br/>
[**Tutorial 3**](https://www.xda-developers.com/file-explorer-windows-11/)<br/>

All 3 sites are very similar in terms of informaion and their approach to teaching about File Explorer, like using step by step methods, links, and imagery. In particular I really like the Georgetown Unviversity's webiste because of the in depth labeling,  especially when showing the layout and all the parts for file explorer.
